# The Command Line

### DOS vs. BASH (Bourne Again Shell)
- In windows the default command line is DOS
- Dos is limited compared to the BASH
- In Windows to overcome the limitations of BASH you have two options
  You can use the GitBash... could pose a challenge finding your directory. 
- In Mac the default command prompt (aka the Terminal) is a utility found in the Finder->Applicatins->Utilities

### Here is a list of the most common BASH commands for this class

- cd ..  #move up one directory
- cd     #move to your home directory
- cd SUBFOLDER #move to a child directory
- cd /PATH/FROM/ROOT 

where the PATH FROM and ROOT are actual folders 
along the path starting from the root
pwd    #print the full path of your current directory

- ls
- dir (windows)

list all files and directories under the current directory

- ls -al 

clear your console

- clear

browse your history

- history

save your history to a file

- history | cat > history2May2020.txt


list a detailed list of files and directories in your current directory

- rm FILENAME 

be very careful with this command once the file is gone it's gone forever
