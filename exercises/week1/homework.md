## A brief history
   **JavaScript** is a high level programming language that conforms to the *ECMA Script* specification.  The language was born in the mid 1990s when early developers of web browsers such as Netscape saw a need to create dynamic content to the original static HTML pages.  However in the last decade, it has exploded in popularity because of its lightweight footprint. On my personal experience, I tried to learn the language in the early 2000s but I found that it was extremely hard to debug since there weren't the tools to help with this task.
